## 🎯 What You Ran

You ran: `bash run_quick_integration.sh`

Results:

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Process Backgrounding**
   - Added `nohup` to properly background API and UI processes
   - Services now stay running after script exit

2. **Health Check Timing**
   - Increased timeouts from 60 to 90 seconds
   - Services have time to fully initialize

3. **Better Error Messages**
   - PostgreSQL errors now show remediation steps
   - API failures more clearly reported
